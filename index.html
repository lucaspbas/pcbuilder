<h1>Learn the ins and outs of building a computer, <br>and all that goes into making one work.</h1>

<h1>The Essentials</h1>
<p>For even the most basic computer, it requires these three essential components as well as a power source.</p>

<h2>CPU</h2>
<p>The CPU is the heart of any computer, just as our heart is what keeps us going. 
It's also the brains of the computer--it's what manages computations, makes the computer run, 
and handles the logistics of the machine upwards of multiple million times per second. It can complete 
commands such as complex math problems before we can blink, or even solve a problem a single or multiple humans
could or ever be able to solve.

Central processing units, or CPUs, have come a very long way their origins as bulky tubes in the 1950's. These days,
they're a usually green square with a size-varying die that looks like a little slab of mirror to us. But underneath are 
extremely tiny electrical paths that communicate at immensely high speeds. The size of these paths aren't measured in mere
milimeters, but instead down to low double and single digit nanometers. Moore's Law describes the rapid change of these processes
in the very short amount of time.

In desktops and laptops, our main x86 architecture CPU manufacturers are AMD and Intel. Competition among both of these companies allows us as the
consumer to be able to have new innovative products as new generations even multiple times a year. In the mobile space, CPUs work a
bit differently, running on ARM architecture. This architecture is more efficient but doesn't meet x86's sheer power.</p>

<h2>Motherboard</h2>
<p>Before we continue to the more intersting parts of a computer, the motherboard is a very much overlooked part in terms
of how we view its usefulness. You can equate the motherboard to our major bodily systems, such as the circulatory system. It's
what connects all of our computer parts, regulates all of the ports and expansions, locks or unlocks features based on processor or
motherboard chipset, and also handles plenty of logic itself. A computer will function perfectly fine with a basic motherboard or a 
high end one, features, chipset, and aesthetics are mainly what determine an expensive motherboard.</p>

<h2>RAM</h2>
<p>Random access memory, or RAM, is our final essential part to a computer. This memory is just like ours, it stores the information that is
being used or one that needs to be accessed often and very quickly, such as our name for us. It is usually found in smaller capacities measured
in lower amounts of gigabytes, but can be equipped with much more and even crossing into terabye territory. This kind of memory is not to be confused
with storage memory, which is what storage drives are for. These operate at gigahertz clock speeds just like CPUs, allowing it to transfer many
double-digit gigabytes of information per second, whereas storage drives operate in megabytes to single digit gigabytes and having much slower latency.
Information stored here is not permanent, anytime power is cut the RAM is reset to a fresh state.</p>

<h1>The Additions</h1>
<p>These components complete the computer, and together create or improve the function of the computer greatly.<p>

<h2>Cooling</h2>
<p>Most CPUs come included with a cooler, which transfers the heat generated by a CPU into a heatsink and into the air somehow. Sometimes this will
be passive in which no fans are required, and a metal contact with the CPU disappates the heat by itself. These are found in mobile devices, thin laptops, or
quiet systems and all have low power CPUs to limit heat. Normally, however, we find that they are cooled by a fan mounted on a heatsink which either has direct 
or connected by copper pipes to the surface of the CPU, and is then distributed to the air by the fan through heat sink fins. On the higher end we have water cooling,
in which a copper plate directs heat through pumped water to a radiator, which is then cooled by a fan, which keeps temperatures very low.</p>

<h2>Storage Drives</h2>
<p>Throughout the years, many standards have been used for storing our data. Floppy drives, CDs, hard disk drives, to more recently solid state drives.
These days hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid disk drives (SSDs) are most common. HDDs use single or multiple magnetic plates spinning usually at 5400 or
7200 times per minute to store data and be accessed by an arm reader. These are quite slow and can be noisy, but are cheaper and come in high capacaties
and up to 10 terabyes per single drive. SSDs on the other hand store data digitally similar to RAM, and are much faster but usually come in smaller capacities
and a higher cost, but can come in larger capacities at an even higher price. This is where files can be stored and read long term, unlike RAM. Interfaces
for these drives can be through USB, SATA, PCIe, SAS, or multiple other ports such as M.2 and U.2.</p>

<h2>GPU</h2>
<p>Graphics processing units, or GPUs, or useful for many things other than just graphics. These PCIe cards however, allow us to display video to very high
resolutions that the CPU or motherboard alone can't support, and allow us to play games with beautiful visuals or excellent performance. These vary much
just as CPUs in terms of different models and capabilities, and recently have hit the low gigahertz range of chip speeds. GPUs are not interchangeable with graphics
or video cards however--a GPU is the processor on the graphics/video card, not the entire thing. This is why many manufacturers make graphics cards, but the GPUs on 
these cards are mainly made only by AMD and Nvidia. 

A GPU is not an essential piece because most CPUs support videos or have small GPUs located inside, but are weak and beyond basic use a GPU is recommended.
These graphics cards can work in addition of two, three, four, or even more on servers or work stations. Some cards contain up to two GPUs as well. These come with
cooling just like CPUs and can be cooled in the same ways. Sometimes they require much beefier coolers to support very high heat output.</p>

<h2>Other expansions</h2>
<p>There are many other expansions that can be used through the PCIe lanes, such as more storage and controllers to run multiple drives together for higher capacity or
speed, as well as other expansions like sound cards, tuners, screen or video recorders, Wi-Fi cards, or extra ports for more fans.</p>

<h2>PSU</h2>
<p>PSUs, or power supply units, are one of the ways we can power our system. These are found in desktops mostly, as laptops and mobile systems are often powered by batteries
or an external power supply to charge things like a laptop. In desktops they range from low power in the low hundred watts to much bigger and expensive kilowatt options.

<h2>Case</h2>
<p>Finally, our whole system is enclosed in a case. These come in many shapes, sizes, functions, colors, and designs to fit your needs or desires. Bigger cases support
more fans, hard drives, bigger motherboards, more video cards, or space for multiple radiators for water cooling. Smaller cases fit only certain motherboard sizes,
single video cards, fewer storage options, restriced cooling options, and limited space.</p>
